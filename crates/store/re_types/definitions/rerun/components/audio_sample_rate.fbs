/// Note that this is a slightly misleading name.
/// An audio file consists of audio frames, each consisting of multiple audio samples.
/// In a stereo audio file, each frame consists of two samples, one for the left channel and one for the right channel.
/// So this should more accurately be called the _frame rate_ of the audio,
/// but it is commonly known as the frame rate for historical reasons.
