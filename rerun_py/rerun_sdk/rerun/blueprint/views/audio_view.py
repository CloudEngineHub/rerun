        Construct a blueprint for a new AudioView view.

        Parameters
        ----------
        origin:
            The `EntityPath` to use as the origin of this view.
            All other entities will be transformed to be displayed relative to this origin.
        contents:
            The contents of the view specified as a query expression.
            This is either a single expression, or a list of multiple expressions.
            See [rerun.blueprint.archetypes.SpaceViewContents][].
        name:
            The display name of the view.
        visible:
            Whether this view is visible.

            Defaults to true if not specified.
        defaults:
            List of default components or component batches to add to the space view. When an archetype
            in the view is missing a component included in this set, the value of default will be used
            instead of the normal fallback for the visualizer.
        overrides:
            Dictionary of overrides to apply to the space view. The key is the path to the entity where the override
            should be applied. The value is a list of component or component batches to apply to the entity.

            Important note: the path must be a fully qualified entity path starting at the root. The override paths
            do not yet support `$origin` relative paths or glob expressions.
            This will be addressed in <https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/6673>.
