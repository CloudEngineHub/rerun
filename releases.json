From this follow various smaller API changes\r\n* Python: `NV12/YUY2` are now logged with `Image`\r\n* `ImageEncoded` is deprecated and replaced with [`EncodedImage`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/encoded_image) (JPEG, PNG, …) and  [`Image`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/image) (NV12, YUY2, …)\r\n* [`DepthImage`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/depth_image) and [`SegmentationImage`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/segmentation_image) are no longer encoded as a tensors, and expects its shape in `[width, height]` order\r\n\r\n🧳 Migration guide: http://rerun.io/docs/reference/migration/migration-0-18\r\n\r\n### 🔎 Details\r\n\r\n#### 🪵 Log API\r\n- Add

    "body": "[Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) is an easy-to-use visualization toolbox for multimodal and temporal data.\r\nTry it live at <https://rerun.io/viewer>.\r\n\r\n📖 Release blogpost: https://rerun.io/blog/blueprint-overrides\r\n\r\n* Python: `pip install rerun-sdk`\r\n* Rust: `cargo add rerun` and `cargo install rerun-cli --locked`\r\n* Online demo: <https://rerun.io/viewer/version/0.17.0/>\r\n* C++ `FetchContent`: https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/download/0.17.0/rerun_cpp_sdk.zip\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/assets/49431240/1c75b816-7e3e-4882-9ee6-ba124c00d73c\r\n\r\n🧳 Migration guide: http://rerun.io/docs/reference/migration/migration-0-17\r\n\r\n### ✨ Overview & highlights\r\n\r\n* 🟦 Blueprint component override & defaults, and visualizer override for all views\r\n  * *Component defaults*: Configure default component value for an entire view, used when no values are logged to the data store (using `rr.log()`).\r\n  * *Component overrides*: Specify a value to use regardless of the data-store & default values and use specified value instead. Can be set per view per entity.\r\n  * *Visualizer overrides*: Specify a visualizer to use for a given entity in a given view. Previously only available for scalar data in timeseries views, now available for all view kinds.\r\n  * All three are available from the (fully revamped) UI _and_ the Python blueprint APIs.\r\n  * Everything that was editable per entity in a view now uses component overrides (e.g. camera plane distance, transform axis lengths, etc.)\r\n  * Tip: Tooltips for each component in the UI include a link to the docs now!\r\n* 🕸️ Improved notebook & website embedding support\r\n  * Now you can stream data from the notebook cell to the embedded viewer.\r\n  * Much improved support for having multiple viewers on the same web page.\r\n  * More configuration options have been added to control the visibility of the Menu bar, time controls, etc.\r\n  * Note: Use `pip install \"rerun-sdk[notebook]\"` to include the better notebook support. This includes the new [`rerun-notebook`](https://pypi.org/project/rerun-notebook/) package, which is used internally by [`rerun-sdk`].\r\n* 🧑‍🏫 New Examples\r\n  * [Paddle OCR](https://rerun.io/examples/video-image/ocr)\r\n  * [Vista driving world model](https://rerun.io/examples/generative-vision/vista)\r\n  * [Stereo Vision SLAM](https://rerun.io/examples/3d-reconstruction/stereo_vision_slam)\r\n  * [Neural field notebook](https://rerun.io/examples/integrations/notebook_neural_field_2d)\r\n* 🛠️ Improved the logging API with many new and updated archetypes and components (see [migration guide](http://rerun.io/docs/reference/migration/migration-0-17))\r\n* 🖼️ `TensorView` is now fully configurable from blueprint code\r\n* 🎛️ Revamped selection panel UI\r\n* 🚚 Much work is being done under-the-hood to migrate our data-store to \"chunks\" (aka units of batched data). More on this in the next release!\r\n  * SDKs are already using chunks to transport data to the viewer, performance characteristics may have changed but should be largely the same for the moment.\r\n\r\n### ⚠️ Breaking changes\r\n* `HalfSizes2D` has been renamed to [`HalfSize2D`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/half_size2d)\r\n* `HalfSizes3D` has been renamed to [`HalfSize3D`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/half_size3d)\r\n* `.rrd` files from older versions won't load in Rerun 0.17\r\n\r\n🧳 Migration guide: http://rerun.io/docs/reference/migration/migration-0-17\r\n\r\n### 🔎 Details\r\n\r\n#### 🪵 Log API\r\n- Introduce chunks and use them on the client side:\r\n  - Part 0: improved arrow chunk formatters

Most things for this already landed in this release and we'll soon build more direct support on top.\r\n\r\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/blob/0.16.0/CHANGELOG.md#0160---first-configurable-views---2024-05-16)"

    "body": "[Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) is an easy-to-use visualization toolbox for multimodal and temporal data.\r\nTry it live at <https://rerun.io/viewer>.\r\n\r\n* Python: `pip install rerun-sdk`\r\n* Rust: `cargo add rerun` and `cargo install rerun-cli`\r\n* Online demo: <https://rerun.io/viewer/version/0.15.0/>\r\n* C++ `FetchContent`: https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/download/0.15.0/rerun_cpp_sdk.zip\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe biggest news is the ability to create a _blueprint_ via the Python logging API. Check out our [associated blog post](https://www.rerun.io/blog/blueprint-part-one) for more information.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport rerun.blueprint as rrb\r\n\r\nblueprint = rrb.Blueprint(\r\n    rrb.Vertical(\r\n        rrb.Spatial3DView(name=\"3D\", origin=\"/\"),\r\n        rrb.Horizontal(\r\n            rrb.TextDocumentView(name=\"README\", origin=\"/description\"),\r\n            rrb.Spatial2DView(name=\"Camera\", origin=\"/camera/image\"),\r\n            rrb.TimeSeriesView(origin=\"/plot\"),\r\n        ),\r\n        row_shares=[3, 2],\r\n    )\r\n    rrb.BlueprintPanel(expanded=True),\r\n    rrb.SelectionPanel(expanded=False),\r\n    rrb.TimePanel(expanded=False),\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe blueprint can then be sent to the viewer with\r\n```py\r\nrr.send_blueprint(blueprint)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr stored to a file, and then later opened in the viewer:\r\n```py\r\nblueprint.save(\"my_nice_dashboard.rbl\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the results looks something like this:\r\n\r\n<picture>\r\n  <img src=\"https://static.rerun.io/blueprint-example/80071610c7a5e668438ebe0392826fbfbd797d30/full.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n  <source

Check out our [associated blog post](https://www.rerun.io/blog/fast-plots) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Overview & Highlights\r\n\r\n- 📈 Rerun can now visualize many time series in the kHz range in real-time:\r\n    - The new query cache optimizes data access, improving query performance by 20-50x\r\n    - Sub-pixel aggregation prevents unnecessary overdraw when rendering plots, improving rendering time by 30-120x\r\n    - [Points](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/points3d), [lines](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/line_strips3d), [arrows](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/arrows3d) and [boxes](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/boxes3d) all benefit from query caching too to a lesser extent, yielding 2-5x performance improvements\r\n\r\n- 🖼 UI overrides:\r\n    - The new `Scalar`, `SeriesLine` & `SeriesPoint` archetypes allow for customizing plots both at logging and visualization time\r\n    - Customize marker shapes, marker sizes, etc from code or directly through the UI\r\n    - Specify axis labels, lock axes, etc from code or directly through the UI\r\n\r\n- 🌁 Viewer:\r\n    - The number of compute threads can now be controlled using the `--threads`/`-j` flag\r\n    - Added support YUY2-encoded images (thanks [@oxkitsune](https://github.com/oxkitsune)!)\r\n    - Space views can now be drag-and-dropped directly from the blueprint tree\r\n    - Scenes with 100+ entities are now up to 5x faster.\r\n\r\n- 🚚 New Space View and Container creation workflow:\r\n    - When selected, containers have a children list in the Selection Panel, where new Space Views and Containers may be added.\r\n    - New modal dialog to add Space Views and Containers.\r\n    - The same dialog is also available from the `+` button of the Blueprint tree UI.\r\n    - The Space View's origin can now be edited in the Selection Panel.\r\n    - The container hierarchy can now be cleaned up with the new `Simplify Hierarchy` button in the Selection Panel for containers.\r\n\r\n- 🦀 The rust SDK now exposes an optional integration with the `mint` crate\r\n- 🕸️ The web UI SDK now supports loading multiple `.rrd` URLs\r\n- 🔺 The web viewer now renders using WebGPU by default (when available), leading to lower memory usage on Chrome.\r\n  You can override this behavior using `?renderer=webgl`/`?renderer=webgpu` url parameter, or restart with WebGL/WebGPU respectively from the options menu.\r\n\r\nAs well as a lot of miscellaneous bug fixes and usability improvements: see details below.\r\n\r\nCheck out our [migration guide](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/migration/migration-0-13).\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n#### 🪵 Log API\r\n- Mark TimeSeriesScalar as deprecated in all SDKs and documentation [#5102](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5102)\r\n\r\n#### 🌊 C++ API\r\n- Document that in C++ PinholeProjection::from_mat3x3 is column major [#4843](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4843)\r\n- Include LICENSE files into C++ SDK Assets [#4870](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4870) (thanks [@rgolovanov](https://github.com/rgolovanov)!)\r\n- Fix C++ arrow build flag forwarding [#4921](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4921) (thanks [@rgolovanov](https://github.com/rgolovanov)!)\r\n\r\n#### 🦀 Rust API\r\n- Add integration with the `mint` crate [#4753](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4753)\r\n\r\n#### 🐍 Python API\r\n- Fix support for compressing mono images by respecting mode to determine depth [#4847](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4847)\r\n\r\n#### 🪳 Bug Fixes\r\n- External loader: don't do process IO on compute thread-pool [#4942](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4942)\r\n- Fix a Visible Time Range UI issue where the summary string would display the wrong data range [#5034](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5034)\r\n- Clear empty containers after tile drag-and-drop [#5044](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5044)\r\n- Allow for very large meshes & plots by always picking the largest available GPU buffer size [#5053](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5053)\r\n- Fix forever repaint of big scenes [#5071](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5071)\r\n- Fix `RERUN_FLUSH_NUM_BYTES` and data size estimations [#5086](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5086)\r\n- Make `rectangle_fs.wgsl` compile on chrome despite angle/mesa bug (#3931) [#5074](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5074)\r\n\r\n#### 🌁 Viewer Improvements\r\n- Introduce Scalar, SeriesLine, and SeriesPoint archetypes with their own visualizers [#4875](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4875)\r\n- Support modifying the plot style by introducing a generic framework for overriding components [#4914](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4914)\r\n- Introduce a new blueprint archetype for AxisY configuration in a plot [#5028](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5028)\r\n- Improve the selection/hover behavior for plots [#5096](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5096)\r\n- Click a spatial space view background to select the space view itself [#4796](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4796)\r\n- Double-clicking an entity in the blueprint & time panels focuses the 3D camera on it [#4799](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4799)\r\n- When loading a .ply file, warn about ignored properties [#4934](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4934)\r\n- Make it easier to position 3D eye-camera center [#4943](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4943)\r\n- Include tessellation and rendering in CPU time shown in top bar [#4951](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4951)\r\n- Allow selection of entities directly in the plot space view [#4959](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4959)\r\n- Texture support for raw `Mesh3D` logging [#4894](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/4894)\r\n\r\n#### 🚀 Performance Improvements\r\n- Add `--threads` / `-j` to control number of compute threads [#5021](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/5021)\r\n- Introduce the query cache:\r\n    -

    "body": "[Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) is an easy-to-use visualization toolbox for computer vision and robotics.\r\n\r\n* Python: `pip install rerun-sdk`\r\n* Rust: `cargo add rerun` and `cargo install rerun-cli`\r\n* Online demo: <https://demo.rerun.io/version/0.8.0/>\r\n\r\n### Overview & Highlights\r\n - `log_pinhole` is now easier to use in simple cases and supports non-RDF camera coordinates. [#2614](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/2614)\r\n   - You only need to set focal length and optional principal point instead of setting the full 3x3 matrix.\r\n   - There is also a new argument: `camera_xyz` for setting the coordinate system. The default is RDF (the old\r\n   default). This affects the visible camera frustum, how rays are projected when hovering a 2D image, and how depth\r\n   clouds are projected.\r\n - The visualizer can now show coordinate arrows for all affine transforms within the view. [#2577](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/2577)\r\n - Linestrips and oriented bounding boxes can now be logged via batch APIs in python.\r\n   - See: `log_linestrips_2d`, `log_linestrips_3d`, [#2822](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/2822) and `log_obbs` [#2823](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/2823)\r\n - Rust users that build their own Viewer applications can now add fully custom Space Views. Find more information [here](https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/extend-ui#custom-space-views-classes).\r\n - New optional `flush_timeout` specifies how long Rerun will wait if a TCP stream is disconnected during a flush. [#2821](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/2821)\r\n   - In Rust, `RecordingStream::connect` now requires `flush_timeout` specified as an `Option<Duration>`.\r\n     - To keep default behavior, this can be specified using the `rerun::default_flush_time()` helper.\r\n   - In Python `flush_init_sec` is now an optional argument to `rr.connect()`\r\n - In Rust, the `RecordingStream` now offers a stateful time API, similar to the Python APIs. [#2506](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/2506)\r\n   - You can now call `set_time_sequence`, `set_time_seconds`, and `set_time_nanos` directly on the `RecordingStream`,\r\n     which will set the time for all subsequent logs using that stream.\r\n   - This can be used as an alternative to the the previous `MsgSender::with_time` APIs.\r\n - The Rerun SDK now defaults to 8ms long microbatches instead of 50ms. This makes the default behavior more suitable for use-cases like real-time video feeds. [#2220](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/2220)\r\n   - Check out [the microbatching docs](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/sdk-micro-batching) for more information\r\n   on fine-tuning the micro-batching behavior.\r\n - The web viewer now incremental loads `.rrd` files when streaming over HTTP. [#2412](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/2412)\r\n\r\n![Open Photogrammetry Preview](https://static.rerun.io/9fa26e73a197690e0403cd35f29e31c2941dea36_release_080_photogrammetry_full.png)\r\n\r\n### Ongoing Refactors\r\n - There have been a number of significant internal changes going on during this release with little visible impact.\r\n   This work will land across future releases, but is highlighted here since much of it is visible through the\r\n   changelog.\r\n   - The layout of the Viewer is now controlled by a Blueprint datastore. In the future this will allow for direct API\r\n    control of the layout and configuration of the Viewer. A very early prototype of this functionality is available\r\n    via the `rerun.experimental` module in Python.\r\n   - An entirely new code-generation framework has been brought online for Rust, Python and C++. This will eventually enable\r\n    new object-centric APIs with a more scalable, consistent, and ergonomic experience.\r\n   - Bringup of C++ support is now underway and will eventually become our third officially supported SDK language.\r\n\r\n### Known Regressions\r\n- Due to the Blueprint storage migration, blueprint persistence on web is currently broken. Will be resolved in:\r\n  [#2579](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/2579)\r\n\r\n### In Detail\r\n#### 🐍 Python SDK\r\n- Clean up warnings printed when `rr.init` hasn't been called

performance improvements for colormapping heavy workload (e.g. segmentation)\r\n    * Try it out in our new [`segment_anything` example](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/examples#segment-anything) that shows off the latest models from Meta AI\r\n* GPU picking & hovering now works with all of our primitives, including meshes & depth clouds\r\n    * This fixes all the shortcomings of the previous CPU-based system\r\n    * Rerun's automatic backprojection of depth textures (\"depth clouds\") is now feature complete\r\n    * Try it out in our updated [`nyud` example](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/examples#nyud)\r\n* Our datastore has been completely revamped to more closely match our latest data model\r\n    * This yields _very significant_ performance improvements for workloads with many events\r\n    * Checkout [this post](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1619#issuecomment-1511046649) for a detailed walkthrough of the changes\r\n\r\n### In Detail\r\n\r\n#### 🐍 Python SDK\r\n- Document that we also accept
