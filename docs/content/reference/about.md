Code & License
--------------
The Rerun SDK & Viewer are open source, all code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/) and open for contributions.
Licensing is permissive, the project is dual licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT) & [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE).


Under the hood
--------------
The software is almost entirely written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a modern, fast and safe programming language.
If you're curious about why we love Rust, checkout our [blog](https://www.rerun.io/blog/why-rust), where we talk about some of the reasons.

We depend on a number of third party libraries, most notably:
* [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) for our data store
* [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/) for rendering
* [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) for UI
* [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) for Python bindings

Commercial Platform
-------------------
Rerun's commercial offering provides managed infrastructure to ingest, store, analyze, and stream large amounts of robotics-style data.

Built around Rerun's open source data model, it makes data pipelines simple to build and easy to operate with built-in visual debugging and prepare data for machine learning.

Rerun's platform provides a single database interface to operate on data from multiple sources, including MCAP, proprietary log-formats, LeRobot Datasets, and multimodal table formats like Lance.

The Rerun Platform is under development with select partners. [Get in touch](https://5li7zhj98k8.typeform.com/to/a5XDpBkZ) if you'd like to be one of them.
