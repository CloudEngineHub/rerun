Sample-rate of an PCM-encoded audio file, in Hz.

Commonly 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz.

Note that this is a slightly misleading name.
An audio file consists of audio frames, each consisting of multiple audio samples.
In a stereo audio file, each frame consists of two samples, one for the left channel and one for the right channel.
So this should more accurately be called the _frame rate_ of the audio,
but it is commonly known as the frame rate for historical reasons.
